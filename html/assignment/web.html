         <h2>3.Then, I would like to share some of my ideas about computer science.</h2>
        <h3>Important!</h3>
        <p>Nowadays, we humanbeings can no longer live without computers, for they have been used widely in almost every field and aspect in our lives.</p>
        <h3>Interesting!</h3>
        <p>As we all know, computer is quite expert at computing. While lots of work can be done by calculating, computers are reducing our labor, making us have more time to do what we want to do. </p>
        <h3>Intelligent!</h3>
        <p>From my perspective, computer science is the only subject which could lead to intelligence aparting from life. Though this job can't be done without the combination with other subjects, it is still the core to achieve that goal.</p>

        <p>Since I am already a student of XJTU, my first goal is to learn diligently and master major-related knowledge well. Secondly, I want to work in a major corporation which aims at high-tech and devote myself to making this world better through technology.</p>
